        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>As a senior and very enthusiast computer engeneer I have worked extensively on some tools dedicated to high availability and performance.</p>

<p>Presentations and courses that I offer are not certified qualifications. My intention is primarily to share advanced experiments that I have had with these technologies.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p><strong>Presentations</strong> and introductions are free, no matter they are done in a associative or professional context. I request only support for transportation costs and accommodation. Presentations are an opportunity to learn more about a technology and to understand when it applies <i>(and when it doesn't)</i></p>

<p>If after a presentation you are interested in going further then the <strong>Training</strong> aim to detail how each of the tools fit into the life cycle of an IT project: design, development, operation, testing, etc ...</p>
